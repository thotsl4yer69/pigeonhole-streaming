# Pigeonhole Entertainment Systems - Kodi Fire TV Cube Optimization Guide

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to the current Kodi setup on the Fire TV Cube device (192.168.1.107) to enhance performance, stability, and user experience.

## Current System Status
- **Device IP**: 192.168.1.107
- **Kodi Version**: 21.2 (stable) - Released January 15, 2025
- **Current Skin**: Arctic Zephyr Mod
- **Installed Addons**: 18 pluginsources including streaming addons

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. System Optimization Scripts

#### a. Kodi v22 Alpha Upgrade Script (`upgrade_to_kodi_v22.py`)
- Prepares the system for upgrading to Kodi v22 Alpha
- Checks current version and prepares repository installation
- Provides step-by-step instructions for APK installation

#### b. Comprehensive Optimizer (`pigeonhole_kodi_optimizer.py`)
- Video settings optimization for hardware acceleration
- Network settings tuning for better streaming performance
- Audio settings adjustment for improved quality
- Service disabling to free up system resources
- Repository updates for latest addons

#### c. WolfLauncher Installation Script (`install_wolf_launcher.py`)
- Automates WolfLauncher installation on Fire TV devices
- Sets WolfLauncher as default home application
- Configures Pigeonhole Kodi integration

#### d. Complete Setup Script (`pigeonhole_complete_setup.py`)
- End-to-end setup and optimization process
- System information gathering
- Repository installation and updates
- Performance optimizations
- Setup reporting

### 2. Configuration Files

#### a. Optimized Cache Settings (`optimized_cache_settings.xml`)
Enhanced cache configuration specifically for Fire TV Cube:
- Increased network cache buffer size (20MB)
- Optimized memory cache settings
- Disabled IPv6 for better network performance
- Hardware acceleration enabled
- Unnecessary services disabled

#### b. Advanced Cache Settings (`advanced_cache_settings.xml`)
Additional cache tuning parameters for high-performance streaming.

### 3. Deployment Scripts

#### a. Kodi v22 Deployment Batch File (`deploy_kodi_v22.bat`)
Windows batch script for:
- ADB connectivity verification
- Kodi v22 APK installation
- Repository file deployment
- Step-by-step upgrade instructions

#### b. Existing Deployment Scripts Enhanced
- `deploy_pigeonhole_gold_complete.bat` - Updated with v22 references
- `deploy_pigeonhole_final.bat` - Enhanced optimization parameters

## Performance Improvements

### Hardware Acceleration
- Enabled MediaCodec and MediaCodecSurface for hardware decoding
- Optimized render method for Fire TV Cube hardware
- Disabled resource-intensive video processing features

### Network Optimization
- IPv6 disabled to reduce connection overhead
- Increased HTTP read rate for smoother streaming
- Reduced CURL retries to prevent hanging connections

### Memory Management
- Optimized cache memory allocation
- Disabled unnecessary background services
- Reduced addon auto-update frequency

### Audio Optimization
- Disabled audio level normalization
- Set GUI sound mode to "only when playback stops"

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate Actions
1. Run `pigeonhole_kodi_optimizer.py` to apply current optimizations
2. Execute `deploy_kodi_v22.bat` to upgrade to Kodi v22 Alpha
3. Install WolfLauncher using `install_wolf_launcher.py`

### 2. Short-term Goals
1. Monitor system performance after optimizations
2. Test streaming quality with various content types
3. Fine-tune cache settings based on real-world usage

### 3. Long-term Roadmap
1. Implement automated monitoring and maintenance scripts
2. Develop custom skin for Pigeonhole branding
3. Create fleet management tools for multiple devices
4. Integrate with VPN/Warp services for geo-restriction bypass

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Buffering**: Increase cache settings in `optimized_cache_settings.xml`
2. **Crashes**: Disable hardware acceleration and use software decoding
3. **Network Issues**: Re-enable IPv6 or check router configuration
4. **Addon Compatibility**: Use v22-compatible addon versions

### Performance Monitoring
- Use `pigeonhole_complete_setup.py` to generate system reports
- Monitor addon performance through Kodi's system info
- Check logs in `.kodi/temp/` for error patterns

## Conclusion
These improvements provide a solid foundation for the Pigeonhole Entertainment Systems Kodi setup, with enhanced performance, better streaming quality, and preparation for future Kodi versions. The modular approach allows for selective implementation based on specific needs and device capabilities.
