    "description": "Use this agent when developing streaming media solutions, particularly for Kodi-based setups, Android TV optimization, sideloading applications, or building comprehensive entertainment systems. This agent specializes in cross-platform streaming architecture with privacy considerations and regional compliance. Examples: <example>Context: User is building a streaming media center setup across multiple devices. user: \"I need to set up Kodi on my Android TV box and ensure it works seamlessly with my other devices\" assistant: \"I'll use the pigeonhole-streaming-architect agent to design a comprehensive streaming solution that accounts for device compatibility, privacy requirements, and regional considerations.\"</example> <example>Context: User wants to optimize their existing streaming setup for better performance. user: \"My current streaming setup is laggy and I want to add VPN integration for privacy\" assistant: \"Let me engage the pigeonhole-streaming-architect agent to analyze your current setup and implement performance optimizations along with Surfshark VPN integration.\"</example>",
