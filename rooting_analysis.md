# Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen (AFTGAZL) Rooting Risk Assessment

## Device Profile
- **Model**: Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen (AFTGAZL) 
- **Android**: 9 (Fire OS based)
- **Target IP**: 192.168.1.107:5555
- **Current Status**: Fully operational with Kodi + Pigeonhole + Surfshark

## CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS
- **PRIMARY**: DO NOT BREAK current operational status
- **SECONDARY**: Maintain Kodi + Pigeonhole + VPN functionality
- **TERTIARY**: Enable advanced customization and automation

## Rooting Methods Analysis

### Method 1: Tank's Fire TV Utility (RECOMMENDED)
**Risk Level**: LOW-MEDIUM
**Success Rate**: 85-90% for AFTGAZL
**Requirements**: 
- ADB access ✅ (confirmed working)
- Android 9 compatibility ✅
- Bootloader unlocked ❓ (requires verification)

**Pros**:
- Designed specifically for Fire TV devices
- Preserves Fire OS functionality
- Includes emergency recovery options
- Active community support

**Cons**:
- May void warranty
- Requires bootloader unlock (may trip Knox/warranty bit)

### Method 2: Magisk + Custom Recovery
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH
**Success Rate**: 70-80% for Fire TV Cube
**Requirements**:
- Custom recovery (TWRP/CWM)
- Bootloader unlock mandatory
- Compatible boot image

**Pros**:
- Systemless root (more stable)
- Module ecosystem
- Hide root from apps
- OTA update preservation

**Cons**:
- Complex installation process
- Higher brick risk
- May break Amazon services

### Method 3: KingRoot/OneClickRoot
**Risk Level**: HIGH
**Success Rate**: 40-60%
**Security Concerns**: HIGH

**Assessment**: NOT RECOMMENDED
- Chinese origin tools with security concerns
- High failure rate on Fire TV devices
- No reliable recovery mechanism

## Bootloader Assessment Strategy

### Phase 1: Status Verification
```batch
adb shell getprop ro.boot.flash.locked
adb shell getprop ro.boot.verifiedbootstate  
adb shell getprop ro.boot.warranty_bit
adb shell getprop ro.debuggable
```

### Phase 2: Fastboot Capability
```batch
adb reboot bootloader
fastboot devices
fastboot getvar all
fastboot reboot
```

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Pre-Root Safety Protocol
1. **Complete system backup** (already scripted)
2. **Verify ADB/Fastboot functionality**
3. **Download stock firmware** for emergency recovery
4. **Test emergency recovery procedure** (dry run)
5. **Document current configuration** in detail

### Emergency Recovery Plan
1. **Stock Firmware Flash**
   - Source: Amazon Developer Portal
   - Method: Fastboot flash
   - Recovery time: 30-60 minutes

2. **ADB Sideload Recovery**
   - Stock recovery.img restoration
   - Factory reset if necessary
   - Manual reconfiguration

3. **Hardware Recovery (Last Resort)**
   - UART/JTAG debugging
   - Professional repair service
   - Device replacement

## Recommended Root Path

### Stage 1: Intelligence & Preparation (SAFE)
- Execute reconnaissance script
- Complete full backup
- Download stock firmware
- Test emergency recovery (dry run)

### Stage 2: Bootloader Assessment (LOW RISK)
- Check bootloader status
- Attempt unlock (reversible)
- Verify fastboot functionality

### Stage 3: Root Implementation (MEDIUM RISK)
- Tank's Utility method preferred
- Magisk as secondary option
- Complete validation testing

### Stage 4: Fleet Deployment (PLANNED)
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Configuration management
- Mass deployment tools

## Success Metrics
- **Operational**: Kodi + Pigeonhole + VPN remain functional
- **Technical**: Root access confirmed with SafetyNet bypass
- **Recovery**: Emergency restoration tested and functional
- **Performance**: No performance degradation

## Abort Conditions
- Bootloader permanently locked
- Emergency recovery failure
- Critical functionality loss
- Hardware damage indicators

## Next Steps
1. Run reconnaissance script to gather intelligence
2. Execute comprehensive backup
3. Download stock firmware for recovery
4. Proceed with bootloader assessment
5. Implement root method based on findings

**RECOMMENDATION**: Proceed with CAUTION using staged approach. Tank's Utility offers best risk/reward ratio for Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen rooting.
