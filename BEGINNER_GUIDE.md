# 🎬 Pigeonhole Streaming - Complete Beginner's Guide

## 📺 What Is This Project?

Your **Pigeonhole Streaming** project is like building your own custom Netflix that runs on Amazon Fire TV devices. Instead of using the basic Fire TV interface, you create a professional-looking media center with your own branding and streaming channels.

### Think of it like this:
- **Before:** Basic Fire TV with Amazon's interface → Limited, looks generic
- **After:** "Pigeonhole Streaming by MZ1312" → Professional, customized, powerful

## 🎯 What Your Project Actually Does

### 🏠 For Home Users:
- Transforms any Fire TV into a custom streaming center
- Adds tons of streaming channels and apps automatically
- Makes it look professional with custom "Pigeonhole" branding
- Lets you control it from your phone/computer via web browser

### 🏢 For Business/Commercial:
- Deploy the same setup to multiple Fire TV devices at once
- Corporate branding and locked-down settings
- Hotel room entertainment systems
- Retail display systems

## 🚀 Quick Start (The Easy Way)

### Step 1: Get Your Fire TV Ready
1. **Turn on your Fire TV device**
2. **Go to Settings → My Fire TV → Developer Options**
3. **Turn ON "ADB debugging"** (this lets your computer talk to the Fire TV)
4. **Write down your Fire TV's IP address** (Settings → My Fire TV → About → Network)

### Step 2: Connect Your Computer to Fire TV
1. **Open Command Prompt** (press Windows key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter)
2. **Type:** `adb connect YOUR_FIRE_TV_IP:5555`
   - Replace `YOUR_FIRE_TV_IP` with the actual IP address (like 192.168.1.130)
   - Example: `adb connect 192.168.1.130:5555`
3. **You should see:** "connected to 192.168.1.130:5555"

### Step 3: Run the Magic Setup
1. **Find this file:** `deploy_pigeonhole_stable_final.bat`
2. **Right-click it → "Run as Administrator"**
3. **Wait and watch** - it will automatically:
   - Install Kodi media center
   - Add streaming apps
   - Apply Pigeonhole branding
   - Configure everything perfectly

### Step 4: Enjoy!
Your Fire TV now shows "PIGEONHOLE STREAMING" and has tons of streaming options!

## 🎛️ Customization Made Simple

### Want to Change Colors/Branding?
**Edit this file:** `config/pigeonhole_config.yaml`

**Easy changes you can make:**
```yaml
branding:
  name: "YOUR NAME HERE"           # Change the title
  tagline: "Your Custom Message"   # Change the subtitle
  primary_color: "FFFF0000"       # Red (change last 6 digits for different colors)
```

**Color Codes (replace the last 6 digits):**
- Red: `FFFF0000`
- Blue: `FF0000FF` 
- Green: `FF00FF00`
- Purple: `FF800080`
- Orange: `FFFF6600`

### Want to Add/Remove Streaming Apps?
**In the same file, find:**
```yaml
essential_addons:
  - "plugin.video.youtube"      # YouTube
  - "plugin.video.thecrew"      # Movies/TV shows
  - "plugin.video.daddylive"    # Live TV/Sports
```

**Add a line** to add more apps, **delete a line** to remove apps.

## 🔧 Advanced Features (When You're Ready)

### Remote Control via Web Browser
1. **After setup, go to:** `http://YOUR_FIRE_TV_IP:8080` in any web browser
2. **You can control your Fire TV** from your phone/computer!

### Deploy to Multiple Fire TVs
1. **Edit:** `fleet-config.yaml` 
2. **Add your Fire TV IP addresses**
3. **Run:** `pigeonhole-fleet-deploy.sh`
4. **All your Fire TVs get set up automatically!**

## 🆘 Common Problems & Solutions

### "adb is not recognized"
**Problem:** Windows doesn't know what `adb` is
**Solution:** Make sure you have Android Debug Bridge installed, or use the included tools in your project

### "Connection refused"
**Problem:** Can't connect to Fire TV
**Solutions:**
1. Make sure ADB debugging is enabled
2. Both devices on same WiFi network
3. Try: `adb kill-server` then `adb start-server`

### "Permission denied" 
**Problem:** Script can't run
**Solution:** Right-click the `.bat` file → "Run as Administrator"

### Fire TV shows error after setup
**Problem:** Something went wrong during installation
**Solution:** Run `kodi_recovery_system.bat` to fix it

## 🎓 Understanding the Technical Stuff (Optional)

### What's ADB?
**Android Debug Bridge** - It's like a remote control that lets your computer control Android devices (Fire TV runs Android)

### What's Kodi?
**Media center software** - Think VLC player but much more powerful, designed for TVs

### What are the Python Scripts?
**Automation tools** - They do all the technical work so you don't have to type hundreds of commands

### What's YAML?
**Configuration format** - Like a settings file that's easy for humans to read and edit
